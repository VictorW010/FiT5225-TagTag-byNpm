# FiT5225-TagTag-byNpm

Tagtag is a cloud-based, serverless application that allows users to store images to public cloud storage (AWS S3) and retrieve images based on automatically generated tags. After the image is uploaded, the program can automatically mark the image and the detected object type.

This is the second version. In the pervious version, it used Yarn and i was in charge of the parts of loading and detecting images. Because the tasks of Fit5225 is a group work,  i tried to complete the application alone.
